# Basics
- Virtualization
- Containerization

## conda
- conda is a virtual environment manager that can host many different types of software -- it is not solely for Python (There is support for Java, R, Rust, etc.)
- conda != Anaconda/Miniconda
  - Anaconda and Minconda serve as a proxy for conda's services by providing a GUI with case to conda and some pre-downloaded libraries (as the name suggests miniconda comes with less pre-downloaded packages)
- conda's virtual environments allow for:
  - The improvement of python dependency management
  - Increased ease of transferring environments -- conda-pack, stores an entire environment as a compressed file
  - Eases experimentation
