  - Windows Remote Management
  - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

## RDP
- Client/Server Architecture
  - Where RDP remote access is enabled is considered the server. The server application listens on the default port for the packet that contains the request from the client computer
- Default port is 3389
- RDP must be enabled on the target computer for the client to connect. By default RDP is disabled
- Connections can be saved in an .rdp file
  - These are files that may want to be explored if found as RDP requires the hostname/IP Address of the server the client would like to connect to
