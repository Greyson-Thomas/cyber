# Commands
- ssh - OpenSSH remote login client
  - A program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine
- telnet - for interactive communication with another host using the TELNET protocol
  - begins in command mode
- nc (netcat) - arbitrary TCP and UDP connections and listens
  - for anything involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets - Examples Below
    - open TCP connections
    - send UDP packets
    - listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports
    - port scanning
    - deal with IPv4 and IPv6
    - network daemon testing
    - TCP proxies
    - shell-script based HTTP clients and servers
- openssl - OpenSSL command line program
  - OpenSSL - cryptographic toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) network protocols and related cryptography standards required by them - Example Use Below
    - Creation and management of private keys, public keys and parameters
    - Public key cryptographic operations
    - Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
    - Encryption and Decryption with Ciphers
    - SSL/TLS client and server tests
- s_client: SSL/TLS client program
  - implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects toa  remote host using SSL/TLS.
  - useful diagnostic tool for SSL servers
- nmap: network exploration tool and security/port scanner
  - uses raw IP packets to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating system -- and version -- theya re running, what type of packet filter/firewalls are in use, and others
  - outputs interesting port table:
    - lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state (open/filtered/closed/unfiltered)
      - open: an application on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port
      - filtered: a firewall/filter/obstacle is blocking the port so that nmap cannot tell whether it is open or closed
      - closed: no application listening on them - could open at any time
      - unfilter: responsive to nmap probes but nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed
  - other target info:
    - reverse DNS names
    - OS guesses
    - device type
    - mac addresses
- nslookup

# Level 13
- ssh-keygen
  - can increase the robustness of the key by increasing the amount of bits used to generated it (-b)
- ssh-copy-id: can be used to transfer the private key to another machine if password authentication is enabled
- if the home directory is encrypted ssh will not be able to access the authorized_keys file thus will default to passowrd authentication

# Level 14
- clients are indirectly connected to the internet through an ISP
- servers tend to be connected directly to the internet
  - the files stored on the server's hard drive are the webpages we use
- servers are able to connect to each other via the Internet and they have identifiers called IP Address
  - IP addresses aren't meaningful to people so we give them names (e.g. www.google.com)
- information is broken down into packets when sending information- packets are reassembled at destination
- Everythign connected directly or indirectly to the internet has an IP address
- Anywhere 2 or more parts of the internet connect there are routers
  - Routers: direct packets around the internet to ensure packets arrive where they need to
## IP address
  - 4 octets - octet = 0 to 255 / 2^8
  - dotted decimal 
  - Functions: Network Interface Identification and Location Addressing 
  - States:
    - Static: Fixed/Permanent
    - Dyanmic: opposite of static
  - Type: 
    - IPV4: 32-bit
    - IPV6: 128-bit
  - The header of each IP packet contains the IP address of the sending host and the destination host
  - Subnetting (come in parts because Networks can be divided into subnetworks):
    - Network Prefix - higher order bits:
    - Rest Field/Host Identifier/Interface Identifier: hosting numbering within the network 
## Subnet Mask/CIDR Notation determines hwo the IP address is divided into network and host parts
  - Subnet mask is exclusive to IPv4
## IP Address Assingment:
  - Dynaimcally: assigned by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration)
    - Allows devices to share the limited address space on a network 
    - enabled by default on most computer
    - Addresses assigned by DHCP is associated with a lease that has an expiration period 
      - if not renewed by host IP address will be reassigned
    - Sticky: dynamic address that rarely changes
  - Persistently: by configured host hardware or software - static Ip Address 
## Routing:
  - Unicast Addressing: single sender/single receiver
    - A device can have multiple unicast addresses
    - Available on both IPv4 and IPv6
  - Broadcast Addressing: address data to all possible destinations on a network in one transmission (all-host broadcast) - all receivers capture the network packet
    - Brodcast Address: 255.255.255.255
    - Direct Broadcast: uses all ones host address with the network prefix
      - ex 192.0.2.0/24 - direct broadcast: 192.0.2.255
        - 24-bits are used to identify the network
        - 8 bits are used to identify the host (2^8 - 1 = 255), last octet is host and all-ones thus direct broadcast
    - Available on IPv6
  - Multicast Addressing: sender sends a single datagram form its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all interested receivers 
    - Only interested receivers receive
    - IPv4 Multicast Address: 239.255.255.255
    - IPv6 Multicast Address: ff00::/8
  - Anycast Addressing: one-to-many topology where the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is closet in the network
    - Built in to IPv6
    - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): handles in IPv4
- Localhost: 
  - IPv4 Resolves: 127.0.0.1/6
  - IPv6 Resolved: ::1
  - Packet Processing:
    - processing occurs in the link layer of the TCP/IP stack
    - packets are never passed to the NIC or hardware device driver and must not appear outside of a computing system or be routed by any router
    - packets received on a non-loopback interface with a loopback source or destination address must be dropped (Martian Packets)
## Ports
- Port: number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service 
  - Software Level: logical construct that identifies a specific process or type of network service 
    - identified for each transport protocol and address combination by the port number assigned to it
    - 16-bit unsigned numbers (0 to 65535)
  - Well-Known Ports: port numbers lower than 1024
  - Ephemeral Ports: all other ports
  - ports can provide a multiplexing service for multiple services or multiple communication sessions at one network address
  - Binding: a process associating its input or output channels via an internet socket (type of file descriptor), assocaited with a transport protocol, network address, and a port number
    - Socket: used to send and receive data via the network 
    - TCP: only one process may bind to a specific IP address and port combination 
  - Port Conflicts: multiple programs attempt to use the same port number on the same IP address with the same protocol 
  - Common for client machines to use ephemeral ports 

## Network Behavior
- Transport Layer Protocols transfer data using PDUs with headers that indicate source and destination port numbers 
  - TCP: Segment
  - UDP: Datagram

## Port Scanning
- port scanner: an application designed to probe a sever or host for open ports
  - port scan: proces that sends client requests to a range of server port addresses on a host, with the goal of finding an active port
  - portsweep: scan multiple hosts for a specific listening port

### Types of Scans
- TCP Scanning: if a port is open, the OS completes the TCP three-way handshake, and the port scanner immediately closes the connection to avoid performing a DoS attack
  - the user does not require special privileges
  - less commoon because using the OS network functions prevents low-level control
  - thought to be "noisy" - can be logged by services and intrusion detection systems can raise alarms
- SYN Scanning: port scanner generates raw IP packets (SYN packet) itself, and monitors for respones (SYN-ACK) then responds with connection closing packet (RST)
  - Form of TCP scanning - never opens a full TCP connection
  - Detailed reporting of responses
  - Individual services never actually receive a connection
- UDP Scanning:
  - UDP is connectionless protocol, however, if UDP packet is sent to non-open port, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message 
    - port scanners of this type infer that a port is open based on the lack of a response
    - firewalls may result in false positives if ICMP message is blocked
- ACK Scanning: determins whether a port is filtered or unfiltered
  - Good for probing for the existence of a firewall and associated rulesets
- FIN Scanning: more surreptious SYN scan
  - FIN packets can bypass firewalls without modification 
  - Closed ports reply to a FIN packet with the appropriate RST packet
  - Open ports ignore the packet on ahdn
- Window Scanning: generates the same packet as ACK scan but checks if the window field of the packet has been modified
  - unreliable scan
