# Commands
- man: an interface to the system referenece manuals
- grep: searches for patterns in each file
  - Patterns is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a pattern
  - A file of "-" stands for standard input 
    - If no file is given, recursive searches examine the working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input
- sort: write sorted concatenation of all file(s) to standard output (sort lines of text files)
  - with no file, or when file is "-", read standard input
- uniq: report or omit repeated lines
  - filter adjacent amtching lines from input/standard input, writing to output/standard output
  - With no options, matching lines are merged to the first occurrence
- strings: print the sequences of printable characters in files
  - for each file give, GNU strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long -- or the number of characters given in the options -- and are followed by an unprintable character
  - mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files
- base64: base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output
  - with no file, or when file is "-", read standard input 
- tr: translate or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output
- tar: archiving utility
- gzip: compress or expand files
- bzip2: a block-sorting file compressor
  - similar command-line options to gzip(deliberate) but not identical 
- xxd: make a hexdump or do the reverse
  - creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input.
  - can convert from hex dump to original binary form
  - can be used to perform binary file patching

# Operators
- ">": redirect standard output (overwriting)
- ">>": redirect standard output (appending)
- "<": redirect standard input
- "2>": redirect standard error
- "|": feeds the output of the program on the left as input to the program on the right
  - Recommended to build pipes incrementally to avoid mistakes

## Operator Notes
- Whenever redirecting or piping the data is sent anonymously. Redirected to or Piped functions will receive content to process but have no knowledge of where it came from 

# Level 8
- Every program run on the command-line has 3 streams:
  - Standard Input [0: STDIN]
  - Standard Output [1: STDOUT]
  - Standard Error [2: STDERR]

# Level 10
- Uses of b64:
  - embed image files or other binary assets inside textual assets such as HTML and CSS files
  - sending e-mail attachments
- b64 characters:
  - A-Z
  - a-z
  - 0-9
  - +,/
  - "=": Padding - used to make last encoded block contain four b64 characters (required with b64 are concatenated)
- b64 process:
  - ASCII = byte values for characters - 8-bit values
  - ASCII bit-values are concatenated in sets of 3 - total length = 24-bits
  - groups of 6 are established from 24-bit string - total groups = 4 groups
- identify bas64:
  - Understand how the text was transmitted
  - Check to the characters used to ensure their within the confines of b64
  - "=" is padding and should only exist on the last content bearing block (should only appear at the end)
    - at most 2 "=" will be present in a b64 string given at least one ASCII character must be present to be encoded

# Level 11
- tr: can be used to rotate character - create a substitution cipher

# Level 12
- compressed files are binaries that can be converted to hexdumps - suggesting a hexdump can be reversed back to a compressed file
- compression can be stacked (e.g. gzip -> bzip -> tar -> tar -> gzip)
  - decompression of every layer would be required to access the data inside the compressed file
