# Commands
- diff: compare files line by line
- bash (Bourne-Again Shell):
  - sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file
- screen: screen manager
  - full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes
- tmux: terminal multiplexer
  - enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen
  - may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached
- bg: resumes job in background
  - send SIGCONT to process
- fg: resumes job as foreground
  - sends SIGCONT to process
- jobs: list the backgroun jobs existing in the job table, along with their job number and job state
  - job tale: list of jobs
  - jobs consist of all the members of a pipeline and their descendents
- disown: used to remove jobs from the job table, so that when the session ends the child process groups are not sent SIGHUP, nor does the shell wait for them to terminate (becoming orphan processes)
  - Upon Session End (User Logs Out): the shell process sends SIGHUP to all jobs, and waits for the process groups to end before terminating itself 
  - Orphaned processes are handled by the OS
  - MOST OFTEN USED so the processes are adopted by init (the ketnel sets their parent process to init) and continue executing as daemons
    - init: the first process run during booting of the OS
- &: appending the ampersand causes the process to start it running in the background - output is directed to the terminal (potentially interleaved with other programs' output), but cannot read from the terminal input
- kill: can signal jobs by job ID as well as by process group ID - sending a signal to a job send it to the whole process group - and jobs specified by a job ID should be killed by prefixing the percent sign "%"
  - kill builtin and send any signal to a job
- crontab: file containing instructions to the cron daemon (time interval process scheduler)

- setuid and setgid allow users to run an executable with the file system permissions of the executable's owner or group respectively and to change behaviour in directories 
  - often used to allow users on a computer system to run programs with temporarily elevated privileges in order to perform a specific task
  - setuid and setgid have different effects, depending on whether they are applied to a file, directory, or binary or non-binary executable file

## Effect on Executable File
- When the setuid or setgid attributes are set on an executable file, then any users able to execute the file will automatically execute the file with the privileges of the file's owner and/or the file's group.
- Allows the system designer to permit trusted programs to be run which a user would otherwise not be allowed to execute
- May pose securrity risk to improperly designed executables

## Effect on Directory
- Causes files and subdirectories created within to inherit its group ownership rather than the primary group of the file-creating process
- Policy is applied during creation

## UNIX Job Control
- Job Control: control of jobs by a shell - job=shell's representation for a process group - a facility to allow users to start processes in the background, send already running processes into the backgroun and bring background processes into the foreground, and suspend or terminate processes
  - process group: a collection of one or more processes
  - Basic Job Control Features: Suspending process, Resuming process, Terminating process
  - UNIX based Job Control brings rise to multiprocessing 
    - Jobs are managed by the OS as a single process group 
- Running in the Background: a task that is running but is not receiving input from the terminal 
- Running in the Foreground: a task that is receiving input from the terminal 
- Job can be referred to by a handle - called the job control job ID
  - Handle: an abstract reference to a resource that is used when application software references blocks of memory or objects that are managed by another system like a database or an OS
- netcat can be used to set up local and remote servers
- tmux is a terminal multiplexer than makes it possible to run multiple instances of a terminal at the same time
  - running multiple instances allows easy multiprocessing
