# How Does the Internet Work (General)
## What is the Internet
- The Internet is exactly as the name suggest a network of networks that communicate between each other using the IP (Internet Protocol) suite. The Internet is a scoped globally and allows for the transferrence of information, resources, and entertainment through the use of services and standardized protocols.

### Who Uses the Internet
#### Normal People
- Using an Internet browser to access Netflix, Wikipedia, GitHub, Amazon, Etc.
- Play multiplayer online games with their friends
- Monitor their estates with internet connected devices (e.g. Amazon's Ring)

#### Business Entities
- Partition their intranet to allow Internet users to access files on their webserver
- Communicate between business entities with online audio and web conferencing platforms
- Collaboratively write and edit documentation with SaaS products

#### Academics:
- Access centrally-held research clusters to process large-scale datasets
- Host webservers to access white papers and other publications
- General Research

#### Governments:
- OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
- Survey the economic, political, and social climate other other regions and regimes 
- Communicate between other governmental agencies to coordinate action (e.g. EPA communicating with local government after rail derailings)

#### Cyber Criminals:
- OSINT: using freely available information to create a profile on their target
- Exchange/Trade illicit goods and services
- Create private forums to speak with other cyber criminals

### How is the Internet Accessed
- The typical procedures of accessing the internet is through an ISP (Internet-Service Provider) that serve the region where Internet is desired. Internet is accessible through many forms:
  - __Dial-Up__: communication established between modems by dialing a phone number on a telephone line 
    - Data transmitted from the sending modem would be modulated from digital to analog through the conventional telephone line to another modem that would demodualte it from analog to digital for the receiving computer to process 
    - Phones could not be used at the same time during the "Internet Call"
    - Download Speed: Approximate Maximum of 56 Kbps (Kilobits per second)
  - __DSL__ (Digital Subscriber Line): Like dial-up, DSL provided a means of communicating over a telephone line
    - Solved the problem non-simultaneous voice and internet over telephone line (allowed concurrent audio and internet use)
    - Download Speed: 12-25 Mbps (Megabits per second)
  - __Cable__: internet that is provided over coaxial cables (same cables as television)
    - Operates similarly to DSLs, in that existing infrastructure is leveraged to simultaneously provide internet and another service
      - Download Speed: Approximate Average 80Mbps
  - __Fiber__: Pulses of light that is transmitted through fiber optic cables - size required to transmit the data is so small that cables are bundled together in trunk cables (have multiple fiber lines) 
    - Form the backbone of the internet by connecting IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) together
    - Utilizes DWDM (Dense Wavelength-Divison Wavelength)
    - Download Speed: 300Mbps - 1Gbps+
  - __Satellite__: A form of wireless internet beamed down from satellites that orbit the Earth
    - Latency is the biggest concern with satellite
    - Download Speeds: Variable 
  - __Wireless__ (3G, 4G, 5G):
    - 3G: 3rd-Generation
    - 4G: 4th-Generation
      - LTE: Long Term Evolution
    - 5G: 5th-Generation 
  
### Advantages and Disadvantages of the Internet
#### Advantages of Internet
- People across the world can communicate - creates spaces where otherwise estranged people can convene and ideate
- Provide access to resources that would otherwise be inaccessible
- Facilitate 
- Refactor of translocating - GPS (e.g. Google Maps, Apple Maps)

#### Disadvantages of Internet
- Continuous innovation increases capabilities of services available but contributes to the digital divide
- People across the world can communicate
  - Bad actors need not be in a centralized location to cooperate
- Accelerate misinformation problem
- Activity and communications can be obsfucated/anonymized/privatized:
  - Encryption
  - Steganography
  - Tor
  - VPN (Virtual Private Network)
  - VPS (Virtual Private Server)


### Who Maitains the Internet
#### Internet Technology Standards
- ISOC (Internet SOciety):
- IAB (Internet Architecture Board):
- IESG (Internet Engineering Group):
- IETF (Internet Engineering Steering Group):
- IRSG (Internet Research Steering Group):
- IRTF (Internet Research Task Force):
- RFC Editor:
  
#### Domain Names and IP Addresses
- ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
- IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)

##### Regional Internet Registries
- AfriNIC (African Network Information Centre)
- ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers)
- APNIC (Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre)
- LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre)
- RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre):

#### World Wide Web
- World Wide Web Consortium

#### Internet Infrastructure
- ISPs (Internet Service Providers):
  - Tier 1: large providers that own operate, and maintain internet infrastructure and backbone (e.g. Verison, Zayo)
  - Tier 2: practice peering with other networks and purchase IP transit to reach other portions of the Internet
    - Most Common
  - Tier 3: Last-mile service - internet providers providing internet to residents 
    - Near solely purchases IP transit from other networks
- IXPs (Internet Exchange Points):
